I will be using 100,000 UK Used Car Data set found at Kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes

"Scraped data of used cars listings. 100,000 listings, which have been separated into files corresponding to each car manufacturer."

- it has 1 table
- it has 9 coloumns
- it has 6 numerical columns and 3 text/category columns.
- The numberical output column is median used car value
- There are 100,000 rows.

This fulfills the requriements of minimal dataset makeup

This is a screenshot to show what the data looks like
